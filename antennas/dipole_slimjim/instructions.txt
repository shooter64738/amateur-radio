8/10mm formers should be printed flat so that supports are only generated in the radii of the part.

8/10mm spreaders should be printed vertical and require no supports.

8/10mm clamp should be printed flat with supports only at the ends of the parts. 

Mount interfaces the 1/2" pvc pipe used to connect the spreaders together to a 2" sch 40 pvc pipe. This may
not be to your liking so you may need to come up with your own mast mount.

Coax connector should be attached to the coax mount, and the cap installed on the coax. The coax is then soldered to 
the connector and the mount cap placed on it. I used drops of super glue to hold the cap in place and then filled
with silicone rubber

All parts interface to 1/2" pvc pipe. These connections are intended to be tight fitting and some sanding of
the hole may be needed.

For antennas over 24" long, 3 formers are suggested. (typically vhf antennas)
For antennas less than 24" long, 2 formers are suggested. (typically uhf antennas)

Once antenna build is complete, seal coax connector, element connector, and element end points with liquid rubber.
